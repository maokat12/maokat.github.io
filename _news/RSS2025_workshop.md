Our work <strong>Sequence Modeling for Time-Optimal Quadrotor Trajectory Optimization with Sampling-based Robustness Analysis</strong> was presented at [Workshop on Leveraging Implicit Methods for Aerial Autonomy](https://im4rob.github.io/) as an invited paper at **RSS 2025**! Check out the [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13915) and [code](https://github.com/maokat12/lbTOPPQuad).
