abstract = {The detection of urban pests, such as bed bugs, has economic and human health implications. The current methods of insect detection leveraged in daily practice include visual inspection; passive interception devices, such as sticky traps; and active monitoring traps, which exude odors that the insects are attracted to. This paper describes recent advancements related to the resonant sensing of trans-2-hexenal vapor, which offers practical utility in bed bug detection. The described sensing system includes a resonant element that is more sensitive than those reported in prior work. The work also details the method by which the functional chemistries were developed, efficiently screened, and evaluated using a multi-channel resonant sensing approach.}
